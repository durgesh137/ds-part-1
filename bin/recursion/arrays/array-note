CORRECT Algo....

1.Check if start index matches arr length, return 0 length array.
2. Make a recursive call to same method search in next index in array, and store the result in subAns array.
3. Check if x is not found at start index, return the subAns[], obtained in step 2
4. else, works, now x is found at start index, hence create ans[] having length as subans.length + 1
	store start index value at index 0 in ans[]
	now copy each element of subAns in ans[] at indexes starting with 1 in ans[], 
	since start index is stored at index 0 already.
