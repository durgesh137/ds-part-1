ArrayList
Internally use array having particular capacity, when it becomes full, new array having length of capacity more than 
previous either 2*previous size, or any other capacity greater than previous one.

Issues with Array
=================
1.Specify the size first, since memory needs to be allocated contiguously hence for space reservations, specifying size
first is must.

LinkedLists
============
Each element in LinkedList is termed as a Node.
For inserting a new element, create new node at any location, thus no need to specify the size first.

How to access elements(nodes) of LinkedList??
-------------------------------------
1. Task of each node is to remember its next node's location in memory,that is, each node must store the 
location of its next node., hence due to this condition the data structure is termed as LINKEDLIST

2. If any node does not have the next node, then null is stored
3. The first node of chain is stored and termed as head, generally last node is termed as tail.

Description of a Node in LL
===========================
It contains two things:
1. one data field
2. next node reference field

The links in LL are very important, in case any link is missed, then access to all other nodes of LL is missed, thus
can never be accessed.

Why use linkedlists??
